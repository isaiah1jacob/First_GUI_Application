# First_GUI_Application

1. Import tkinter package and all of its modules.

2. Create a root window. Give the root window a title(using title()) and dimension(using geometry()).  All other widgets will be inside the root window. 

3. Use mainloop() to call the endless loop of the window. If you forget to call this nothing will appear to the user. The window will wait for any user interaction till we close it.
